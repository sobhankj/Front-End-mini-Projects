# Front-End-mini-Projects
A collection of front-end mini projects built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to practice and improve my skills through real-world components, layouts, and UI experiments.

# ðŸ§© Project 01 - Baseus Product Cards UI

A simple front-end layout built with HTML and CSS, inspired by a Baseus product listing.  
Includes product cards with title, price, discount, and rating.  
My first mini project to practice layout and styling basics.
